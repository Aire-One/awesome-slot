# Awesome WM - Slot

A declarative API to connect signals for the AwesomeWM.

It completes the native `gears.signal` module to make signal connection easier
to manage.

## Documentation

API references for the latest release are available at <https://aire-one.github.io/awesome-slot/index.html>.

It is also possible to manually build the documentation locally using ldoc. The
documentation content is part of the source code, and all configurations needed
are provided by the `config.ld` file. To generate documentation, you need to
run :

```sh
ldoc .
```

The documentation site will be generated in the `doc` directory.
